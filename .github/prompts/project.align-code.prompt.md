You **MUST** implement changes from the inspection report `tmp/report.md`.
If it does not exist, STOP and ask for it.

You **MUST** implement changes one by one, ensuring each change is complete and correct before moving to the next. When you finish a change, cut the text from report `tmp/report.md` and paste it into a file `tmp/report.done.md`.
