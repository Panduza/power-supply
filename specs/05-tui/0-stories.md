# 05 - Terminal User Interface (TUI) — Stories

## Context
The TUI feature provides a terminal user interface to control and monitor the power supply.
It is not a command line interface with arguments, it is a real interface with widgets inside the terminal.

## User Story 1 — Control Box (P1)
As a user, When I start the tui, I want to see the 3 main information I need on the power supply:
- Power state ON/OFF
- Voltage value
- Current value
