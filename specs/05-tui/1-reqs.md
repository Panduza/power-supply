# Requirements: TUI

**Created**: 2025-11-22
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-22
**Status**: Draft

## Summary

One-line summary of the TUI feature and its value. Replace this placeholder with a concise description that references `specs/05-tui/0-stories.md`.

## Functional Requirements

- FR1: [Placeholder] Describe a single behavior the TUI must provide (link to story IDs from `0-stories.md`).
- FR2: [Placeholder] Another discrete, testable behavior.
- FR3: [Optional] Additional behaviors as needed.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR1: [Placeholder] Performance, accessibility, or UX constraints (e.g., responsive terminal sizes).

## Acceptance Criteria (mandatory)

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

## Testable Outcome (mandatory)

- Describe at least one observable, automated test or manual verification that demonstrates the requirement is met (e.g., "running `cargo test --lib` exercises parser for TUI commands" or "start app, open TUI route X, and observe Y").

## Tests (if required)

- Unit: [what to test and expected behaviour]
- Integration: [external systems, mocks or fixtures]

## Dependencies

- `specs/05-tui/0-stories.md`
- Any crates, tools, or external services required to implement or test the TUI.

## NEED CLARIFICATION

When the authoring agent requires more details to complete these requirements, add a `NEED CLARIFICATION` section with explicit, numbered questions and do NOT invent missing answers. Example placeholders:

1. What exact screens or routes should the TUI expose (list by story ID)?
2. Which terminal sizes and compatibility (TTY, Windows Console, etc.) must be supported?
3. Are there accessibility or keyboard-only navigation requirements?

Replace the example questions above with the actual questions needed; wait for user answers before completing requirements.

## Notes / Open Questions

- Move any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items here once questions are answered.
